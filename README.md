# Real Time Code editor

This repository contains a real-time code editor web application built with React for the front end and Node.js with Express and Socket.IO for the back end. It supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit code simultaneously with syntax highlighting. The app features multiple coding rooms, and auto-saving capabilities. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies for both the server and client, and run the app locally. This project provides a strong foundation for building collaborative coding platforms. Contributions are welcome!
